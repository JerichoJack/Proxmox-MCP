## 🔧 Bug Fix: Authentication Issue Resolved

### Problem
The HTTP server was failing on startup with authentication errors:
```
Failed to initialize Proxmox API for 192.168.4.13: No valid authentication credentials were supplied
```

### Root Cause
The HTTP server was trying to initialize `ProxmoxAPIManager` during startup, which immediately attempted to connect to all configured Proxmox nodes. If any node was unreachable or had authentication issues, the server would show errors (though it continued running).

### Solution: Lazy Initialization
✅ **Implemented lazy initialization pattern**:
- API manager is now initialized only when first tool is called
- Clean server startup without premature authentication attempts
- API connections established on-demand when actually needed

### Benefits
- **Faster Startup**: No blocking on node connectivity during server init
- **Better Error Handling**: API errors only occur when tools are used, not during startup  
- **Improved User Experience**: Clean startup messages without authentication noise
- **Resilient Operation**: Server starts successfully even if some nodes are temporarily unavailable

Both servers now start cleanly and establish API connections only when tools are actually invoked!
